      "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of organic compounds, such as glucose. This process occurs in specialized organelles called chloroplasts, which contain pigments like chlorophyll that absorb light energy.\n",

      "\n",
      "6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 O2\n",
      "\n",
      "In simpler terms, photosynthesis involves the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Light absorption: Chlorophyll and other pigments absorb light energy from the sun.\n",
      "2. Water absorption: Plants absorb water from the soil through their roots.\n",
      "3. Carbon dioxide absorption: Plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air through tiny openings on their leaves called stomata.\n",
      "4. Energy conversion: The absorbed light energy is converted into chemical energy, which is stored in glucose.\n",
      "5. Oxygen release: Oxygen is released as a byproduct of photosynthesis.\n",

      "\n",
      "**What is a Neural Network?**\n",
      "\n",
      "A neural network is a computer system inspired by the human brain's structure and function. It's composed of layers of interconnected nodes or \"neurons\" that process and transmit information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How Does it Work?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a complex problem, like recognizing an image of a cat. A neural network would:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Receive input data (e.g., pixels from the image)\n",
      "2. Pass the data through multiple layers of neurons, each performing a specific task (e.g., edge detection, color recognition)\n",
      "3. The output is calculated by combining the results from each layer\n",
      "4. The final output is used to make predictions or decisions\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Layers**: Multiple layers of interconnected nodes process and transmit information.\n",
      "* **Activation Functions**: Each node applies a mathematical function to the input data, introducing non-linearity and enabling complex patterns.\n",
      "* **Training**: Neural networks are trained on large datasets to learn patterns and relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Types of Neural Networks:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Feedforward Networks**: Data flows only in one direction (from input to output).\n",
      "* **Recurrent Networks**: Data can flow back and forth between layers, allowing for temporal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Applications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Neural networks have numerous applications in AI, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Image recognition\n",
      "* Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
      "* Speech recognition\n",
      "* Predictive modeling\n",
